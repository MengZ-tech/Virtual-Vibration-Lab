make the time-domain signal change as you want, and see what is going on in freq-domain

Create your own envelope shape - yea you can even draw it

Another thing I would like to mention is to illustrate how the shock arrival time (or, would you call it Uncertainty?) influences the Fourier spectrum (which is quite a common case in the real world). Be aware that the "random jitter" may not be the most accurate case when it comes to the components like bearings. check: FDS-MOMEDA: optimization-blind deconvolution in finite high-dimensional spaces for extracting pulse signal in rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Measurement Science and Technology, 35(8), 086140. https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ad4dcb

Use "random jitter (of the shock arrival time)" button to see the effect on FFT results:
